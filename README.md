PROBLEM STATEMENT
Every passing second, an equivalent of a rubbish truck load of clothes is burnt or buried in landfill. Waste is prevalent in every part of the fashion industry, as a result of overproduction, over consumption and problematic end-of-life solutions.
Our project aims to put an end to this problem by providing an opportunity to reuse clothes and to donate clothes for the greater good.

DESCRIPTION
The main aim of our project is to help those who lack the basic amenity,i.e. clothing.This is achieved by providing the users of the website,a whole new platform to donate clothes,to people who actually need them.
Another salient feature of this website is that,it aims to revive the traditional way of shopping,the barter system.Bartering can result in the optimal allocation of resources by exchanging goods in quantities that represent similar values.This website allows the users to choose either to donate or to barter clothes.

SOCIAL IMPACT
The Various impacts that we aim to achieve through our website includes:
	1.Donating Clothes reduces Landfill waste
         2.Old Clothes brings Smiles and Helps those in need
          3.A Circular Economy with a Sustainable Lifestyle
